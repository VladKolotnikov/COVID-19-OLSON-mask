    <h3 class='subTitle'>About COVID-19</h3>
    <p id='aboutP'>	COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges we as humanity are having to face today. Thousands dying world wide, and according to the statistics gathered by ECDC out of the 150,000 deaths, 34,000 took place in America. The U.S. is currently in the lead both in number of infected, and deaths from coronavirus. This has got to stop, and the only way we can stop it is by being ready to defend ourselves and those around us. This is why we created this website to spread our cause and our vision. The vision of the path we need to take , together, to end this nightmare. We must band together to protect those who canâ€™t protect themselves, and in doing that we will also protect ourselves.

    <h3 class='subTitle'>What We Do</h3>
    <p id='actionP'>	This virus is a problem that affects all of us, and that is precisely why we need to band together to solve this crisis. That is why we started this project. We hand make masks to give them out to hospitals and doctors who fight on the front of this war for survival, as well as to those. Who can not afford to make or buy these masks. Every single mask saves the person wearing it, and those around him, which is why it is vital everyone has access to it. We would greatly appreciate volunteers to take this project up in their areas by creating and providing masks to people living around. We also graciously accept donations. 100% of the money we gather goes to buying supplies for masks and supporting hospitals in any way we can. Together we will stop this pandemic. One mask at a time!</p>
